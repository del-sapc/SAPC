These workflows are independent of each other:
 
1. wf_dicl_check_stage_buffers: 
- Create the placeholder in staging table so that the sequences generated thorugh staging framework don't intersect the the one's created by Custom Loader.

2. wf_dicl_failure_notice:
- In DICL_AUDIT, creates an entry for failure
- In DICL_AUDIT_DETAILS, details of the failure captured

3. wf_dicl_purge:
- Invokes API to SAPC to run the purge pipeline
- Purges all the data loaded to staging, mirror and custom loader based on the number of days specified.
- Unix script associated:

4. wf_dicl_vt_update:
- DICL_AUDIT: Update the status of VT progress to VT complete.
- DICL_AUDIT_DETAILS: Add any VT errors that occured during import for the batchname in details table
- This process will run scheduled every 5 mins in background and check if any V&T that has been logged into DICL_AUDIT 
  table is complete or not in the SAPC UI. If complete , the process will mark the corresponding record in DICL_AUDIT table 
  as “V&T-Complete”.

       
Pre-Requisite:     
• HPEC_DICL_AUDIT	- Main Audit Table which tracks the status of the File processing
• HPEC_DICL_AUDIT_DETAILS - Error details of data in the file being processed.
• HPEC_DICL_CODE_TABLE - Code to value mapping required for Audit record entries.
• HPEC_DICL_AUDIT_SEQ - Sequence to populate the HPEC_DICL_AUDIT table
• HPEC_DICL_VT_CONTROL - Configurable table to control the Validate and Transfer options, during Import, for every Inbound process 
  (AUDIT tables need to be created in AppZone, not Landing Pad as the table size will keep on growing)
• DICL_CODE_TABLE: Gets the CODEVALUE of the process as below:
      CODEVALUE		DESCRIPTION
       1		    File Received
       2		    File Staging - In Progress
       3		    File Staging - Complete
       4		    Validate and Transfer - In Progress
       5		    Validate and Transfer - Complete
       6		    File Creation - In Progress
       7		    File Creation - Complete
       9		    Process Failure
